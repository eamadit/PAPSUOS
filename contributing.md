You are free to bring your brick until rules are designed


Immediate needs:


# analysis of the existing abstraction layers between hardware and software, in particular the OS


# gather the first layer of assembly code in each OS and abstraction layer analyzed





# design a scalable abstraction layer which communicates in assembly code in all sides

PAPSUOS shall have a modulable kernel, all the communications with the hardware and the separation of functions shall be addressed in assembly so that any device which is accessible via the bootloader can be seen from a linux device on which runs the first version of the separation kernel creation tool


# design a tool linked to a database which allows creation of a core separation kernel


# design the core separation kernel

Each hardware driver shall be isolated in a separate read only partition to prevent privilege escalations
